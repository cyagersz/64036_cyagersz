## Question 1 

Run the following code in R-studio to create two variables X and Y. 

set.seed(2017)

X=runif(100)*10

Y=X*4+3.45

Y=rnorm(100)*0.29*Y+Y

```{r}
set.seed(2017)
X=runif(100)*10
Y=X*4+3.45
Y=rnorm(100)*0.29*Y+Y

# Question 1.a
plot(X,Y,main = "Scatterplot of Y vs X",
     xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", pch = 19, col = "blue")

# Question 1.b
model1 <- lm(Y ~ X)
summary(model1)

# Question 1.c

print(cor(X, Y)^2)

```
