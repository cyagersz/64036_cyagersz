## Introduction
This is a notebook that demonstrates the setup and of R and Rstudio, installing packages and using basic functions to look at the data set Carseats. 

```{r}
#Install ISLR packages

installed.packages("ISLR")


# This loads the ISLR library 
library("ISLR")


# This views the summary of carseats data set
summary(Carseats)


# This views amount of rows in carseats data set
nrow(Carseats)


# This shows the max value of advertising
max(Carseats$Advertising)


# This shows the IQR of price

IQR(Carseats$Price)


# This plots the data set attributes of sales vs price

plot(Carseats$Price, Carseats$Sales,
     main = "Sales vs Price",
     xlab = "Price",
     ylab = "Sales",
     col = "Blue", pch = 19)

# This shows the correlation between the two attributes

cor(Carseats$Sales, Carseats$Price)


# 2. The number of rows observed in this data set is 400
# 3. The Maximum value in the advertising attribute is 29
# 4. The IQR of the Price attribute is 31. Also can be found doing Q3 - Q1, which is 131-100 = 31
# 5. In the graph I see as the price is lower sales are way up and as price gets higher the sales go down. The sign of the correlation being negative means as the prices get higher, sales will get lower or as prices get lower sales will increase.
