## Introduction
This is a notebook that demonstrates the setup and of R and Rstudio, installing packages and using basic functions to look at the data set Carseats. 

```{r}
#load packages


library("ISLR")


# View summary of carseats
summary(Carseats)


# View amount of rows in dataset
nrow(Carseats)


# Shows the max value of advertising
max(Carseats$Advertising)


# IQR of price

IQR(Carseats$Price)


# plot of sales vs price

plot(Carseats$Price, Carseats$Sales,
     main = "Sales vs Price",
     xlab = "Price",
     ylab = "Sales",
     col = "Blue", pch = 19)

#correlation between the two attributes

cor(Carseats$Sales, Carseats$Price)


# 2. The number of rows observed in this data set is 400
# 3. The Maximum value in the advertising attribute is 29
# 4. The IQR of the Price attribute is 31
# 5. In the graph I see as the price is lower sales are way up and as price gets higher the sales go down. The sign of the correlation being negative means as the prices get higher, sales will get lower or as prices get lower sales will increase.Also as seen in the graph you can see as price goes up the sales go down and as price goes down sales go up.
